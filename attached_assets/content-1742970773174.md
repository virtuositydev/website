### Riding  on a very successful Datacenter Virtualisation initiative, Deployment   of an Enterprise-grade Kubernetes Platform for Modern Applications was   on the next agenda.         | \# **5**<br>\#\#\#\#\#\# DevOps Components Deployed | \# **1**<br>\#\#\#\#\#\# Private Cloud Environment with Orchestration | \# **100+**<br>\#\#\#\#\#\# Training Hours Conducted | | --- | --- | --- |

##### **Background**

###### As one of the largest   digital telecommunications and connectivity service providers in the   country, the Client already had a dynamic team that came from different   IT functions - each team architected, developed and deployed   applications differently. In recent years. the Client also had also   successfully completed an implementation of a Sofware Defined Datacenter  (SDDC) with self-service capabilities a strong governance process put   in place.      To leverage the potential of their success, as part of a Digital   Transformation initiative, the next step was to extend the private cloud  services by introducing a common enterprise-grade Kubernetes based   platform capable of running modern applications to provide opportunity   for their developers to explore application modernisation; and to   harmonise and improve the process of application deployment.

##### **The Journey**

###### Virtuosity's original   scope of engagement was to design and implement a Kubernetes platform   capable of deploying modern applications to the client's private cloud.   Upon a successful deployment, the next steps were to ensure each team   could utilise the common platform for their applications. As there were   some teams that were at a different application development maturity   stage, Virtuosity took the extra step to advice and introduce basic   DevOps tools i.e. CI/CD, logging; etc.; and processes into their   application development.       The final step in the journey was a verification of the platform.   Our definition of verification would be, not only that the platform   technically functioned, but that the client would be able to experience   and operate the platform independently. This was achieved with our ADIL   (A-Day-in-Life) methodology by onboarding a couple of critical   applications for the client to experience the process. This was done   successfully and the client has been operating the platform on their own  with minimum support from Virtuosity.      Today, the Kubernetes platform has become the   mainstream platform for the Client and they have adopted a   "Kubernetes-first" policy for all application development. This   translates to the fact that the Client is very serious in their   Application Modernisation movement but more importantly, they are   comfortable with the technology and process put in place.      Client and Virtuosity are moving forward towards   enhancing the DevOps process, including exploring new ways of doing   application DR, and introducing more DevOps tools to promote   standarisation, efficiency in their software development process. New   tools and improved processes will provide great potential to develop   powerful mission critical applications.

### A new business   strategy has dictated the modernisation of the existing digital delivery  team to help the organisation achieve its transformation goals.

##### **Background**

###### The client is a   facility services conglomerate and is looking to evolve into a digital   services driven organisation. Quick routes to market were identified   such as monetising applications they developed for their daily   operations as well as acquiring start-ups to grow their service   offerings.

##### **The Journey**

###### Our initial steps were   to conduct a maturity assessment exercise on the client's digital   delivery team, where we found areas for improvement, ranging from   fundamental matters such as lack of Linux familiarity and manual   tracking/logging of change request tracking/logging, to manual software   delivery lifecycle without governed source control and release   management.      We tracked and remedied these identified matters through training   sessions as well through a series of design workshops, where the   delivery team was empowered with a DevOps platform to remove manual   steps by transforming them into digital processes.      Following the successful deployment of a production-ready   Kubernetes-based DevOps platform, as part of our methodology to enable   our client, we performed a practical test on the client's delivery team   capability to onboard a legacy application on to the DevOps platform.   Our objective of getting the client to experience our ADIL   (A-Day-In-Life) concept of learning was ACHIEVED.      Overall, the 3 months engagement was deemed a success. It spurred   the client team's desire to achieve much more. Virtuosity's   collaboration with the client is already moving forward to bring the   next stage of growth to support its transformation goals.

### The Financial   Services Industry (FSI) has a new race in finding new and innovative   ways to connect with customers. The race is about putting banking into   their hands with speed and agility. State-of-the-art mobile and online   banking will require a robust developer ready platform and reactive   operations to power the future of banking. Implementing a sound   Developer Ready Infrastructure (DRI) with an Enterprise-grade Kubernetes  platform equipped with the best-of-breed DevSecOps tools and processes   allowed for a good launching pad.

##### **Background**

###### As one of the largest   digital banking players in the region, the Client had a vision to   re-invent banking. With the advent of modern applications methods and   supporting technology, new and traditional players in the Financial   Services Industry can race forward to meet on a level playing field. The  vision was to bring convenience of banking into the hands of their   customers - with the mobile banking landscape accelerated by the   Covid-19 pandemic to become the new norm.      The client started right by leveraging on their   private cloud, to develop and deploy applications to a common   enterprise-grade Kubernetes based platform capable of running modern   applications on a private cloud. DevSecOps tools and processes were put   in place to provide efficiency in application deployment and monitoring.

##### **The Journey**

###### Virtuosity's initial   scope of engagement was to design and implement a Kubernetes platform   capable of deploying modern applications to the Client's private cloud.   That initiative was quickly achieved with their existing IT   infrastructure by introducing a complementary Enterpise-grade Kubernetes  platform, coupled with a capable Client team. The next challenge was to  ensure that the basic DevOps tools and processes were put in place for   better usability, sustainability and maintainability.      Virtuosity's Expert-on-Demand services (XoD),   offered an advisory role in working with a technically capable Client   team to provide recommendations, implementation and knowledge enablement  services related to their Kubernetes Platform and; DevSecOps tools and   processes.      XoD is a unique service which provides the Client   with the confidence that an expert, in a particular topic of concern   within their platform, is just a call away when they need someone to   help investigate a critical issue or require further knowledge   enablement to be self-sufficient to support their environment.      Today, the Client continues to engage Virtuosity as  a Partner via XoD services to support their platform team and to   discover further enhancement opportunities.
